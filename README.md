# to-do-app
Design from frontendmentor.io a functional to-do app

This app taught a lot of things to me. I messed up with code I must fix later. I should use a random id and use the filter function. I used the drag and drop library. It 
wants an array with ids like [1,2,3,4,5] (this means 5 items in drag and drop area.). I should change how delete add clean operation. I will update the branch.

## npm install
## npm run dev
